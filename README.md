# multimodal-database
This is the course project for Database Systems (CS322)

The code is for a server that acts as an interface that maintains the multimodal database. It accepts socket connections for receiving data then inserts/updates the appropriate fields in appropriate databases. It adds fields like name, age, visited cities, gender etc in a PSQL database and it writes all other data in a document.
